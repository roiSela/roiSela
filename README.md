### Hi there 👋

# 🏄 Roi Sela

**'Digital Crafsman (Software engineer/technologist/electrical engineering student/mathematician)'**

I'm a technologist building my version of the world one step at a time (corny, but C'est la vie).
All coding projects are build from ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.
